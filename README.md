A simple javascript garden tracking application which runs offline in the browser.  Use it to keep track of everything you've got planted and make plans for what you'll be planting in the future.

This app is under heavy development, so there's no instructions on getting up and running with it yet. I'll add more info as the app matures to a level where it's usable.
