See project homepage at [tinymighty.github.io/sembr](http://tinymighty.github.io/sembr)

sembr is an offline-first browser based crop planning and tracking application.

Built on the shoulders of these giants

* Semantic UI
* Backbone
* Marionette
* Ractive
* Hoodie
* CouchDB


We're preparing a prototype release shortly.  Until then if you want to hack around; create a new _Hoodie_ project, symlink the sembr `src` directory as `www` in the hoodie project, and run `hoodie start`.
